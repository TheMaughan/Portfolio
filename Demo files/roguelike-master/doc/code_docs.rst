Code Documentation
==================

At the top level, the ``__main__.py`` file will create an instance of the
``GameWindow`` class. This class manages the GUI and responds to events.

The next layer down is the ``GameEngine``. This is more of a logic layer, although
it isn't completely divorced from the display.
