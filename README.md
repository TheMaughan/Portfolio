### AutoCAD Project:

This project was completed December 2020

The project is a structural, architectual, and a siteplan draft design for a lakehouse. The project is not intended to be used for any actual building. The project was originally made for the purpose of learning the 2D drafting tools in AutoCAD.

The model for the lake house was originally from Autodesk's AutoCAD-2020 textbook, I added my own customizations while drafting my own version of AutoCAD's lakehouse.
