# Overview

The main purpose of this folder is to demonstrate my knowledge of the Python language.

I made my own version of the Atarii Asteroid game to demonstrate my proficiency of the programming language Python. The game's main classes and class families are grouped into their own files much like the Java language. I did this so that the code that I write within the different game files could be easily duplicated for other projects and for any added features and effects that I would add to the game, for example, partical effects for explosions and engine smoke, a second player, and a menu system.

Run the game from within the 'Game_World.py' file.

# Development Environment

I created both programs in Visual Studio Code

I also used Python Arcade to generate the essential game engine physics and utility.

# Useful Websites

I have found these webpages very helpful for understand key Python principles used in this project:

* [Python's Main Website](https://www.python.org/)
* [Python Arcade Library](https://arcade.academy/index.html)

# Future Work

Within this month, I plan on using my knowledge of Python to explore web app creation using Django. I plan on furthering my education of web app development by integrating C# and .NET, and React/Angular (Whichever one is better).
