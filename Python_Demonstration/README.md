# Overview

The main purpose of this folder is to demonstrate my knowledge of the Python language.

I made my own version of the Atarii Asteroid game. Originally this game was for a class assignment and is the most complex program that I have made using Python. 

The game's main classes and class families are grouped into their own files, much like how a program is written in Java. I did this so that the code that I write within the different game files could be easily duplicated for other projects and adding things to the game, like a menu system, would be easier to do in this state.

Run the game from within the 'Game_World.py' file in a code editor, I will post a '.exe' file shortly.

# Development Environment

I wrote all my code for this game in Visual Studio Code.

I used Python Arcade Library to generate the game window and for some important utility.

# Useful Websites

I have found these webpages very helpful for understand key Python principles used in this project:

* [Python's Main Website](https://www.python.org/)
* [Python Arcade Library](https://arcade.academy/index.html)

# Future Work

Within this month, I plan on using my knowledge of Python to explore web app creation using Django. I plan on furthering my education of web app development by integrating C# and .NET, and React/Angular (Whichever one is better).
