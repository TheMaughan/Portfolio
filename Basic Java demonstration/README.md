# Overview

The main purpose of this folder is to demonstrate my knowledge of the Java language.

Within this folder are two simple ecommerse programs. The ecommerse program was originally created in a language I'm familiar with, Python, which I transalated into Java. I included the Python program to compare the two languages.

I like to use this ecommerse program whenever I learn a new language because it uses all the nessesary OOP principals in the most simple form.

# Development Environment

I created both programs in Visual Studio Code

# Useful Websites

I have found these webpages helpful for understand key Java principles:

* [Java Web Toutor](https://javawebtutor.com/articles/corejava/arraylist-of-custom-class-object.php)
* [Baeldung](https://www.baeldung.com/java-printstream-printf)

I used W3schools for learning Java syntax

* [W3schools.com](https://www.w3schools.com/java/default.asp)

# Future Work

I plan on continueing to develop my skills in Java by including inheratance, polymorphism, data structures, Abstraction, and Encapsulation. To begin useing these OOP methoods I'm going to enable customer account creation, with an username and password, product selection, a transaction history search, and anything else I can think of.
